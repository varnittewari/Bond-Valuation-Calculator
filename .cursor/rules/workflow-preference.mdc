# Coding workflow preferences
- Focus on the areas of code relevant to the task
- Do not touch code that is unrelated to the task
- Write thorough tests for all major functionality
- Avoid making major changes to the patterns and architecture of how a feature works, after it has shown to work well, unless explicitly instructed
- Always think about what other methods and areas of code might be affected by code changes
- Every function should do one thing and do it well. Its name should reflect that single purpose.
- Keep different parts of the application separate. UI code should be separate from API communication logic, which should be separate from business logic.
- Frontend validation is for user experience. Backend validation is for security and data integrity. The backend must never trust data coming from the client. It must re-validate everything.
